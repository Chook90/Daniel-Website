                    <p>My path here has been anything but linear—I come from a background in analysis, but it was my own journey through trauma, transformation, and cultural immersion across the globe, that truly shaped my calling. Over the years, I've lived and travelled across several countries, studying with meditation teachers in South Asia, the Middle East, and New Zealand. These experiences deepened my understanding of the many ways we heal, grow, and reconnect with ourselves.</p>

                    <p>From a young age, I was drawn to the unseen—to the energies that speak without words and the healing that happens beyond the physical. I didn't always have the language for it, but I felt called by something higher: a quiet yet persistent pull toward spirit. Being a HSP and an empath, I came to understand that this sensitivity was not a weakness—it is a gift. I would find strangers consistently drawn to sharing their stories with me.</p>

                    <p>One of the most meaningful parts of my work is that healing often happens in the most unexpected places. I once shared a taxi ride with a driver who, in the course of casual conversation, opened up about the recent loss of his mother. As he spoke, his grief surfaced. I held space for him—not with advice, but with presence and empathy. By the end of the ride, I could see that a powerful catharsis had taken place. And before I stepped out of the car, he took a moment to say a prayer for me.</p>

                    <p>It reminded me that healing isn't something that only happens in formal sessions. It happens when we meet each other soul to soul, when we truly see and hear one another. Moments like that affirm why I follow this path—led not by a script, but by spirit and trust in higher guidance.</p>

                    <p>It became clear that I was here to help others reconnect with their own inner wisdom, to hold space for deep healing, and to guide those seeking a more soulful, aligned way of living.</p>
